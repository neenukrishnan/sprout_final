              <p class="tab_content_heading">OUR APPROCH</p>
       <p class="history_p">       We believe in doing business in a way that is fair, transparent and, above all, safe and sustainable. 
              These are the fundamentals of responsible practice. Without them we cannot build the trust and good 
              faith on which we trade.<br><br>
              At Sprout Group we know that a responsible business is a sustainable business. We take our responsibilities seriously –
and none more so than health and safety. No other matter – commercial or operational – takes precedence over the well
being of those involved in or affected by our activities. We have set ourselves the target of eliminating all accidents from
our operations. This is an ambitious goal. But we are confident we can achieve it through the commitment of all our
people to put health and safety first in everything they do. While this is – and will remain – our greatest priority, we
recognize that our responsibilities extend beyond this. To ensure our sustainability agenda delivers maximum value, we
begin by understanding the role we are expected to play in dealing with the social, economic and environmental challenges
of our time.<br>
Modern society is changing at a pace not seen since the industrial revolution. While the world’s population rises
exponentially, major demographic shifts are transforming global dynamics. Mass migration to towns and cities, an emerging
middle class in developing nations and an ageing population in the western world are placing unprecedented demands on
energy, water, food, housing, infrastructure and the environment.As businesses strive for commercial sustainability in
challenging conditions, they must at the same time respond to a new economic framework where competitive advantage
is determined by the social and environmental dividends of their operations.
The way we manage these interconnected issues will have a material impact on the success of our business. But if we are
to achieve our objectives, we must be honest about the scale of the undertaking, committed to finding the right solutions
and prepared to admit we don’t have all the answers.<br><br></p>

              <p class="subheading">HOW WE STRUCTURE OUR ACTIVITIES</p>
              <p class="history_p">      Our sustainability agenda is organised into four key areas :
              <br>
              Health and safety, people, environment and marketplace. In our Indian hub our sustainability activities are known as our
EPIC agenda. Against each of these components, we have set clear targets and expectations that focus our activities on
the areas where we can make the most positive impact or where risk of negative consequences, if not adequately
addressed, is greatest.<br></p>
        <p class="subheading"><br>OUR PRIORITIES</p>
        <p><span class="span_heading">Health and safety:</span> To protect the health and safety of everyone involved in or affected by our operations. <br>
          <span class="span_heading">People:</span> To attract, develop and retain world-class talent, creating an environment that inspires our people to give their best
          and makes human capital one of our greatest differentiation. <br>
          <span class="span_heading">Environment:</span> To minimise the negative impacts of our operations and maximise the quality of the built environment for
          future generations. <br>
          <span class="span_heading">Marketplace:</span> To achieve the competitive advantage by delivering maximum value to all our stakeholders – clients, suppliers,
          communities and the wider industry.<br>          
        </p>
        <p class="subheading">SUSTAINABILITY POLICY</p>
        <p class="history_p">Sustainability is about maximizing our environmental, economic and socio-economic performance, in the interests of the
          business, our stakeholders and our planet. Sprout Group is uniquely placed through our private ownership to take a longterm approach to sustainability. This policy sits alongside our Health and Safety, Environment, Human Capital and Customer
          Service policies as part of our global policy framework.<br>
          As an Enduring Engineering Enterprise we are implementing a strategy which aims to create sustainable growth by meeting
the economic, social and environmental challenges of our rapidly changing world.<br>
</p>
<p class="span_heading">Sustainability will be pursued as an integral part of fulfilling our corporate vision. We will continually strive, and expect,

    <p class="history_p">  Our policies are reviewed and updated annually to react to client needs and evolve with the world around us to make
Sprout Group the company of first choice for all our stakeholders, whilst challenging and changing the image of
engineering worldwide.

              <p class="tab_content_heading">HEALTH & SAFETY</p>
              <p class="history_p">Sprout Group is committed to constantly challenging our performance and pushing the boundaries so 
                that our approach to Health and Safety (H&S) is aligned to the evolution of the Sprout Group 
                strategy, remains effective and fit for purpose for the sectors and markets in which we operate and 
                positively influences H&S outcomes in everything we do.<br>
                In recent times, our aspiration has been to shift our people’s relationship with health, safety and 
                well being from one which is transaction and compliance based towards a more empowering relationship 
                where people are encouraged and supported to use informed judgement and sound risk management 
                techniques.Underlying this focus is the H&S Strategic Direction. This defines the actions and focus 
                of leadership and management in providing effective oversight and management of H&S at all levels 
                across the business in the following areas:</p>
                <p class="subheading">Disciplined delivery</p><p>– supporting the embedment of the Global Minimum Requirements(GMRs) in achieving a more disciplined and consistent delivery model.</p>
                <p class="subheading">Strong risk management</p><p>- transforming people’s relationship with H&S by empowering them to care and manage risk through informed judgement.</p>
                <p class="subheading">Driving innovation</p><p>- utilising the innovation pathway to provide focus and direction to solutions that can positively affect safety outcomes.
                    We also remain committed to ensuring our operations remain focused and engaged and to reviewing the composition of the function to ensure we remain as effective as 
                    possible in executing this strategy. Although we operate in a dynamic environment and changes will be made to 
                    enhance our strategy, the H&S Strategic Direction is resolute and focused in these areas.</p>
                <p>Achieving this aspiration relies on the implementation of a simple and effective framework that assists our day-to-day decision making and helps our business function safely. Our 2018 GMRs drive this approach across five stages of the operational lifecycle. These include governance, investment, design and planning, establishing work environments and delivery, setting
                  parameters on the control and elimination of key risk events faced by our business. There is a deliberate focus on front-end planning and strong risk management meaning that safety begins for Sprout Group well before a project commences and irrespective of the working environment.
                <br><br>The H&S Strategic Direction and GMR Framework are essential components in ensuring the safety, health and well being of our people remains our priority. This approach also empowers people to identify and manage H&S risks that are applicable to them, promotes moving beyond minimum statutory and organisational requirements, and leads to innovation and continual improvement. They are all key attributes in our aspiration to create places that care and which are free from incident and injury.</p>

We strive to save natural resources by using raw materials, energy and other resources efficiently. Our most important raw materials are renewable bio-based raw materials, which we use to produce high-quality products primarily for the construction, laminate and packaging industries. Our products are safe to use and they fulfill the legislation regarding their intended use, also concerning the environmental and safety impacts of the chemicals used in</p>
                <p>production. Our products are recyclable or reusable, or they extend the life-cycle of the intended end use products. We commit to use GMP (good manufacturing practice) and defined in-house controlling verified by third party in our production of food contact materials.</p>
                <p>We support sustainable forest management and we use Chain of Custody tracing systems for raw materials to ensure that all of the wood raw material and pulp originates for legal and approved sources. We also require that our raw material suppliers commit to the requirements of our Chain of Custody (CoC) management systems.</p>
                <p class="subheading">Work Safety and Social responsibility</p>
                <p>In all of our operations, we adhere to ethical business practices and we create a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. We respect human rights through equality in our operations and by developing working conditions. We strive to systematically prevent accidents and hazardous situations as well as illnesses caused by work or working conditions. We have also prepared to operate in the situations of emergency as well.</p>
                <p class="subheading">Management and governance</p>
                <p>Sustainability and safety issues are part of management and the related responsibilities are defined at all organizational levels. We require that our personnel acknowledge their responsibilities and adhere to the commitments and obligations concerning their work. We strive to ensure the personnel’s awareness of the requirements through communication and training. The management team assigns the required resources and
                  participates in the operations by carrying out regular safety audits, by setting targets and by regularly reviewing the success in reaching the targets and the sufficiency of resources.</p>
                <p class="subheading">Diversity</p>
                <p>Our enduring success relies on generating new and different ideas and perspective. At Sprout Group, we want our business to be representative of our people and their communities. To us, diversity and inclusion means embracing variety in our workforce, valuing different perspectives, building a flexible organisation and respecting stakeholder diversity. Good work can be achieved in many ways. We’re making great strides equipping our manpower with the skills to lead an inclusive, flexible workplace.</p>
                <p class="subheading">Innovation</p>
                <p>Business sustainability is essential, both for us and our customers. As we evolve responsibly, we always look for smarter and better ways of doing things. It’s this attitude – and our willingness to roll our sleeves up and give anything a go – that has taken us from humble beginnings to progressive, proactive industry leaders, open to new ideas and new ways of doing
                  things.</p>

                <p class="history_p">Sprout Group aims to leave a positive and lasting impact on the communities and stakeholder that we interact with. This may be through activities such as providing learning, skilling, and workforce participation opportunities, supporting just and fair employment, and promoting local procurement on our projects. Climate change will not just impact our physical assets, it will also affect our communities, and especially the most vulnerable within them. By creating places that are resilient to the impacts of future climate change we are enabling the communities that use them to
                be resilient as well. We aspire to create places that are accessible and safe for the people who use them and strive to improve the wellbeing of our
                people, our subcontractors and the communities where we have a presence.
                Sustainability is a key driver of our competitive advantage and helps to generate long-term value for many of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. Our sustainability commitments and ambition help to position us as a partner of choice for our customers, attract and retain talent in the organisation, which helps to drive innovative and resilient solutions across our business. Our evidence-based approach also helps us to proactively respond to the increasing expectation and scrutiny of investors and capital partners.</p>
